In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't updating in real-time even though I was using the `onValue` listener.  The listener was attached correctly, and the data was changing on the server-side, but the changes weren't reflected in my app. This was specifically happening when data was updated from another client. I narrowed it down to a race condition where the client that initially reads the data, makes changes, and writes those changes back before the other listener(s) had a chance to observe and react to the changes, thereby creating a situation where the UI never reflects the latest changes.
